# SafeDrop
### Safe Drop System Project
The SafeDrop project was created to combat an issue we identified with online peer-to-peer marketplaces: the in-person meetups. We set out to design a system which would allow users to exchange second hand goods for money without meeting in person. By eliminating this user meetup, SafeDrop increases security, reliability, and convenience for both the buyer and seller. 

Executing this project involved creating a safe box with pin-code access where users could drop off and pick up goods and a full website dedicated to creating and managing these transactions. Users could post their second hand goods, purchase existing postings, choose a drop-off location, and exchange their goods for "SafeBucks" (which would have eventually been a full payment system with real world money). Users were sent a pin code to access the safe through the in-website chat feature on the SafeDrop website. They would also receive a picture of the item after it was dropped off to verify delivery.

Our system allowed for users to return an item back into the box if it was found to be unsatisfactory and the built in image recognition and weight systems ensured a secure return.
